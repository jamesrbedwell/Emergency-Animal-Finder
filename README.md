# Emergency Animal Finder

A web app to be used during natural disasters to help lost animals get reunited with their owners.

## User Stories

During a natual disaster, such as a bushfire, people are frequently separated from their pets, either because the person was not at home during the evacuation notice or if the animal is lost during the evacuation.

People who have lost an animal will be able to log onto our app, choose which incident they are involved in and search to see if the animal has already been listed as found.  If not, they can post an image and description of the animal.  

People who have found or rescued animals can also log onto the app, search to see if someone has lost the animal, and post an image and description of the animal, including where the animal was found, and where the animal is currently located.
